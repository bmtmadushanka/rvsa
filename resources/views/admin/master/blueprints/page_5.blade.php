        <p><strong>NOTE: </strong> The RAW Work Instruction Identifier is a detailed extracted from the scope and shown on the Model Report cover page along with its version number shown on the RH bottom of page. The RAW unique document identifier is the Master Model Report No. shown on the LHS top of each page, whereas the Model Report Vehicle ID number (MR<span class="placeholder" data-id="5.1" style="background: #fff; color: #000; padding:0">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</span>) shown on the RHS top of page becomes the UNIQUE document identifier to be used by the AVV for the verification process.</p>
        <p>It should clearly be noted that the Model Report does not cover the obligation of the modifier of a vehicle to provide a roadworthy vehicle at the first time of registration within Australia. The Model Report may cover many aspects of the roadworthy requirements, but may not in all cases. A detailed vehicle inspection should be undertaken & any other faults found should be actioned outside the scope of this Model Report.</p>

    <h1>ORDER OF IMPLEMENTATION </h1>
    <p>It is recommended that both the RAW & AVV follow the <b><u>CONTENT LISTING</u></b> of this Model Report in order to efficiently modify & verify the vehicle. </p>
