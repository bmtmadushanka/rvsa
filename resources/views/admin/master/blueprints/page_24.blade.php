        <p>This section of the Vehicle Scope (Work Instruction) contains a number of controlling features as listed above. It has been setup in ADR order using only the related Applicable Australian Design Rules (ADR’s) which apply to this Model Report. The revision level of the ADR’s is based on the build range date of the vehicle detailed in this Model Report. However, sometimes a later revision level of an ADR may be used if the vehicle also meets all the matching technical standards in that ADR as well. This Section can be used by the RAW to follow the Work Instructions & to assist the AVV with the verification process. Each ADR section includes a component section to assist in the identification process, a deterioration section to show the accepted level of deterioration, the rectification process & the use of alternant parts and also contains a modification section which provides detailed steps to modified the vehicle when required to comply with that particular ADR requirement.</p>
        <p>The Author of this Model Report also uses the individual ADR templates to store a full Evidence Pack in a special add-on section at the end of each section. This section is used by the Model Report author to provide compliance detail to the Department but is not available to the Raw or AVV.</p>
