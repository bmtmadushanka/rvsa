        <p>The first step for the RAW & AVV to do, is determine that the actual SEVâ€™s entry vehicle matches the Concessional RAV Entry approval document in terms of vehicle identification. The original OEM VIN identification stamping should be inspected & the last 7 digits recorded in the space provided at the start of the VEHICLE SCOPE - Vehicle Details section of the Model Report (Page 6). These last 7 digits should also match the last 7 digits of the Concessional RAV Entry document 17-character VIN detail. If it is determined that the vehicle ID does not match the RAV document then further processing must not proceed. Details should be reported back to The Department.</p>
        <p>The second step for the RAW & AVV, is to check that the actual vehicle matches the VEHICLE SCOPE (Pre-modification Specifications) & Vehicle Scope (Work Instructions) sections as detailed within this Model Report. The RAW & AVV need to check & select the correct variant when applicable. The appropriate variant box at the start of each Vehicle Scope detail should ticked when it applies. If it is determined that the vehicle does not match the Pre-modification Specifications at this point, then the processing must not proceed & the Model Report approval holder should be contacted & all discrepancies recorded.</p>
        <p>The AVV must also check the Model Report is the latest version licensed to the RAW Facility by checking the actual 17-character VIN of the vehicle & matching it with the QR Code displayed at the bottom on each page of the Model Report.</p>
